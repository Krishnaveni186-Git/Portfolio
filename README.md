I recently built a Sales Dashboard in Power BI to analyze performance and uncover business insights. This dashboard not only tracks key sales metrics but also leverages the Forecasting feature to project future trends, helping in better decision-making and planning. ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

Key highlights of the dashboard:

 âœ… Interactive visuals for sales performance

 âœ… Region-wise and product-wise breakdown

 âœ… Trend analysis with time-series forecasting

 âœ… Clear insights for strategic growth
